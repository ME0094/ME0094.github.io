| **Version** | 1.0 (2026-10-09) |
| **Review trigger** | A vendor or government statement that asserts or denies identity; a new joint advisory |
| **Author** | Martín Eliseo |

## Bottom line

We assess with **moderate confidence** that "VOLTZITE" (Dragos) and "Volt Typhoon" (Microsoft and the
U.S. government) are best treated as an **overlapping ecosystem, not a verified single actor**. The
probability that they are literally the same organisational unit is **unlikely** (~20–45%). The
overlap is consistent with a **brokered-access mechanism** — a separate cluster establishing footholds
and passing them on — at **low confidence**.

The discriminating evidence is not the shared tradecraft (which is common and non-diagnostic) but the
vendors' own language: Dragos's "extensive technical overlaps", MITRE's weaker *Associated Groups*
recording, and the documented SYLVANITE access broker.

## The question

This assessment answers a standing requirement: *"Where vendor designations diverge, how much
confidence does the evidence support for treating them as the same actor?"* (see
[Requirements](/requirements/)). It matters because a naming judgement changes decisions — an incident
responder, a hunting team or a procurement choice should not treat two designations as one actor
without a stated confidence.

## Why a structured technique

Unstructured comparison drifts toward the most recent or most authoritative-sounding source. **ACH
(Heuer)** forces the alternatives to be written down and tests the evidence against all of them at
once. It favours the hypothesis with the **least inconsistent** evidence, not the one with the most
supporting data — which is the trap when every hypothesis shares the same visible TTPs.

## Hypotheses

- **H1 — Same actor.** VOLTZITE and Volt Typhoon are one organisational entity under different vendor
  names.
- **H2 — Distinct but overlapping.** Separate teams or units that share tooling, infrastructure,
  targeting or tasking, tracked separately by different vendors.
- **H3 — Brokered / shared access.** The overlap is produced by an access broker or shared operational
  support that hands footholds to more than one consumer cluster, without a single actor.

H3 is a mechanism that can coexist with H2; it is tested on its own because it makes a different
prediction about *where* the overlap comes from.

## Evidence

| # | Evidence | Source |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | Dragos describes VOLTZITE as sharing "extensive technical overlaps" with Volt Typhoon rather than being declared identical | [7] |
| E2 | Dragos's VOLTZITE is its analyst designation for the OT-facing activity, not an identity claim | [7] |
| E3 | CISA lists Voltzite among the aliases in its Volt Typhoon advisory | [1] |
| E4 | MITRE records the tracking names as Associated Groups — explicitly weaker than "same actor" | [3] |
| E5 | Same targeting: critical infrastructure and OT (communications, energy, transport, water) | [1][7] |
| E6 | Same tradecraft: living-off-the-land, valid accounts, SOHO proxying | [1][3] |
| E7 | SYLVANITE establishes footholds on edge devices and hands them to Volt Typhoon / VOLTZITE | [3][7] |
| E8 | Stage 2 ICS Cyber Kill Chain activity attributed to VOLTZITE | [7] |
| E9 | No public statement by any vendor asserting identity; the language used is overlap | [3][7][10] |
| E10 | Government advisories list Voltzite as an alias, implying sameness at the campaign level | [1] |

## Consistency matrix

`C` = consistent · `I` = inconsistent · `0` = neutral or ambiguous.

| Evidence | H1 (same) | H2 (overlap) | H3 (brokered) |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | I | C | C |
| E2 | 0 | C | 0 |
| E3 | C | 0 | 0 |
| E4 | I | C | 0 |
| E5 | C | C | C |
| E6 | C | C | C |
| E7 | I | C | C |
| E8 | 0 | C | C |
| E9 | I | C | C |
| E10 | C | 0 | 0 |

## What the matrix shows

- **H1 carries four inconsistencies** (E1, E4, E7, E9) and is the least supported. ACH favours the
  hypothesis with the least inconsistent evidence, not the one with the most supporters.
- **H2 has no inconsistencies** and explains every observation, including the vendors' own careful
  language.
- **H3 has no inconsistencies** and is the most parsimonious explanation for E7 (a broker that hands
  footholds onward) and for part of E5–E6.
- The **discriminating** evidence is E1, E4, E7 and E9 — all linguistic or structural. Shared
  tradecraft (E5, E6) is **non-diagnostic**: consistent with every hypothesis, which is exactly why
  actor identification should not rest on TTP overlap alone.

## Judgement

1. Best treated as **separate but overlapping** (H2) — **moderate confidence**.
2. That they are the **same organisational unit** (H1) — **unlikely** (~20–45%).
3. That the overlap is at least partly **brokered** (H3) — **roughly even chance**, **low confidence**.

## What would break the tie

- A government or vendor statement that explicitly **asserts or denies identity**.
- Published **infrastructure or code reuse** establishing a shared operator rather than shared tooling.
- Details of **SYLVANITE tasking** — whether it serves one consumer or several.
- A **joint advisory** naming VOLTZITE and Volt Typhoon together as one actor or as distinct.

## Intelligence gaps

- Vendor taxonomy is internal and seldom explained; "overlap" is not a standardised term.
- Dragos's 2026 report is the load-bearing source (E1, E2, E7, E8) and represents a single vendor.
- No access to private telemetry or shared-infrastructure analysis; this is an open-source assessment
  and is bounded by that.
